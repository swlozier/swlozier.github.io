<p>In Redshift and Portalmetal, the end of the world is not a departure from the harsh realities of life. Border checkpoints, healthcare inaccessibility, and discrimination all exist in opposition to the protagonist. It was brought about by the self-devouring monstrosity that is neoliberal capitalism, as the nearing very real environmental apocalypse is in reality. The characters react nonchalantly. New home planets and teleportation do little to end the despair of reality. In Queers in Love at the End of the World, the titular end is a known quantity never more than ten seconds away. Whether you scramble to accomplish some sort of closure or just take it easy, you and your partner will be gone soon. The end of the world is melancholic and unavoidable. Neither protagonist seem all that caught up in the end or how it came about, resorting to reluctant acceptance. In our world ravaged by a deadly virus, profiteering neoliberal fascist politicians, inaccessible healthcare, the first unnatural mass extinction event, extreme climate change, a widespread migrant crisis, legalized slavery, every flavor of bigotry, wealth inequality worse than the gilded age, a new global cold war, uninterrupted colonialism, and more, I can understand divesting from reality a bit.</p>
