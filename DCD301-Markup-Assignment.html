        <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; border-color: #a0f2b4; padding-botto: 1em">Task</h3>
        <p>Choose a meaty passage from Frankenstein (~500-1000 words) that is rich in character and setting. Following rules and practices of TEI, mark-up this passage so that it may be machine-readable, as if you were preparing a rich digital edition. Read
            this passage closely and mark-up the following things:</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>characters (including pronouns);</li>
            <li>settings (including pronouns or other unnamed references);</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because you will be working closely with people and places in the text, you should also plan to create and include a &lt;TEIHeader&gt; with appropriate metadata for all Headers, and additionally a:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personography (for hosting more detailed information about your characters)</li>
            <li>Placeography (for hosting more detailed information about your places)</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>Since you will be working with a relatively small amount of text, you should plan to create a rich marked-up file.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b><span class="" style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);">Remember that you will need to work in a plain text editor (<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">like Sublime</a>), set to XML.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

    <div>Your grade for this part of the digital edition assignment will be calculated according to the following:</div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div><b>CONTENT ACCURACY (30%)</b>: Is your mark-up accurate according to Frankenstein? (i.e. is you tag "she" as "Elizabeth," is right?")</div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div><b>SYNTAX ACCURACY (40%)</b>: Does your mark-up follow the rules of XML syntax and TEI guidelines? Have you nested your tags correctly? Have you used attributes correctly? Do your elements and attributes actually exist in TEI?&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div><b>RICHNESS / ROBUSTNESS (30%): </b>Have you followed the guides above and 1) chosen a rich passage and 2) marked it up in a way that is sufficiently robust?</div>
