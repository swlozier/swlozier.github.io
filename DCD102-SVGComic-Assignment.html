    <p>This is your major assignment to close out unit 3. It is a scaled down, but still relatively hefty assignment that brings together everything we've done in this unit: SVG and images.<br></p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom:.5em; border-color:#F038FF">Basic Task</h3>Create a single image "comic" that features two tangram animals (drawn with SVG) having a conversation (via SVG text and thought / speech bubbles) in a real place (a photographic image background).<br></div>
<div style="margin:2em">Each comic must feature the following:</div>
<div style="margin:2em">
    <ul>
        <li>2 <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/257408934923279530/" target="_blank">tangram-style animals</a> drawn with SVG (inspo on Google images; remember each shape you use should be evident in the final product; so think about stroke and fill
            colors that will allow you to do this)<br></li>
        <li>a real photograph for place to create the setting</li>
        <li>at least one speech or thought bubble for each animal that shows their conversation</li>
    </ul>
</div>

    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom:.5em; border-color:#F038FF">Designer's Statement</h3>
    <p>In addition to creating these three modifications, you will be responsible for writing a short designer's statement in which you reflect on your designs and discuss them in terms of the following:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>What were your design goals for this comic?</li>
        <li>How well do you think you achieved each of these goals?</li>

        <li>What was the most challenging part of this mini-project?</li>
        <li>If given more time / resources, what would you improve on this mini-project?</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom:.5em; border-color:#F038FF">Submission</h3>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Zip (Compress) the folder directory that contains your image(s), HTML file, and stylesheet (if you use one).&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Upload that zipped folder here on Moodle.</li>
        <li>Submit your designer's statement as a PDF file</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom:.5em; border-color:#F038FF">Assessment</h3>
    <p>In assessing this work, I will be looking for the following:</p>
