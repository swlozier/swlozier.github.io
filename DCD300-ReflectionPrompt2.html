<h4><span>REFLECTIVE POST:</span></h4>
<p>For the final week of content in this shortened semester, we looked at two texts that imagine "end of the world" scenarios, though in both cases, the end of the world is configured differently that our traditional or expected "end of the world" stories.
    From the texts' points of view to their endings, they each prompt us to question how we understand the end of the world, so to reflect on this further, please choose a prompt below to respond to:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
    <li>In each of these texts, how is the end of the world imagined? What event bring it about? How do the characters react to the world's end? How are these elements of the texts different from other "end of the world" texts you're familiar with? Thinking
        of our current global pandemic as a kind of "end of the world" event, do you find either of these texts particularly resonant? Are there connections you can draw to your experience of COVID or lockdown? Are there connections you can draw to other
        large-scale disasters (eg: hurricanes)?</li>
    <li>Thinking about your quickmake and the role that programming time or requiring your player to experience something in real-time plays in digital storytelling, what are some narrative instances where you exert this kind of temporal control? How does
        this kind of narrative control affect the empowerment of the reader/player that we typically attribute to digital narrative?&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
