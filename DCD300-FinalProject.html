    <h3 style="text-align: left;">About</h3>
    <p>For your final project in this class, you will have the opportunity to create a digital novel on the topic and in the platform of your choice. Of course, with only one week (and some change) to work, this will likely not be as fully realized as the
        digital novels we've read this semester, however your digital novel should contain a complete story with characters, settings, plot, and themes, and it should demonstrate a critical engagement of digital / computational elements that support your
        storytelling. As well, it will be accompanied by a reflective designer's statement, wherein you articulate your design ideas and process for creating this text.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3>General Prompt</h3>
    <p>You may use this opportunity to tell any story you like. If you are stuck, consider exploring one of the topical trends we encountered this semester:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>a story that re-imagines an existing text (a fairy or folktale, for instance);</li>
        <li>a story that re-imagines or re-writes a historical event or time period</li>
        <li>a story that fictionalizes a nonfiction event</li>
        <li>a story that satirizes or parodies some aspect of contemporary culture</li>
        <li>a story that imagines the end of the world&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regardless of what topic your story covers, it should feature the following elements:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>characters</li>
        <li>settings</li>
        <li>plot</li>
        <li>recurring themes / imagery / ideas&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is up to you where you want to focus your writing and story telling energies on each of these areas, but they should all be present to some extent.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3>Tech Specs &amp; Expectations</h3>
    <p>For this project, you may work in any platform you like, but it must be one that we encountered this semester in one of our primary texts. These platforms (and the texts built in them) are:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://twinery.org/" target="_blank">Twine</a> (<em>Depression Quest, Quing's Quest VII, Queers in Love at the end of the World</em>)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/" target="_blank">Inky</a> (<em>Salt Immortal Sea, First Draft of the Revolution</em>)</li>
        <li><a href="https://scalar.me/anvc/scalar/" target="_blank">Scalar</a> (<em>Redshift and Portalmetal</em>)&nbsp;</li>
        <li><a href="http://inform7.com/" target="_blank">Inform 7</a> (<em>Blue Lacuna</em>)</li>
        <li>Raw HTML / CSS (<em>Twelve Blue</em>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whichever platform you choose, your use of that platform should include computational work (coding, perhaps) beyond the basics of the platform, in ways that match the quick-makes and formal foci of the semester including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>inclusion of images and other multimedia</li>
        <li>inclusion of text styling and other custom CSS elements</li>
        <li>inclusion of computational "tricks" like readers-as-writers, real-time constraints, conditionals, or variables</li>
    </ul><strong>In other words: I will be looking to see that you are critically and carefully using the affordances of digital, computational media to enhance your storytelling beyond "reader interaction" or choice-based narrative.<br><br></strong>
    <p></p>

    <h3>Reflective Designer's Statement</h3>
    <p>Along with your final digital novel, you will also submit a reflective designer's statement: a written document where you articulate (in paragraph form) your design process and goals for creating this text.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your designer's statements should be 500-750 words and address the following:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How did you come up with the topical idea for your story?</li>
        <li>How did you decide which platform to use to tell your story?</li>
        <li>How does your digital novel use the affordances of digital, computational media to tell your story?</li>
        <li>What additional (code)work did you do beyond the basics of the platform? How does this (code)work enhance or otherwise contribute to your story?&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Where did you struggle in this project? How did you overcome these struggles?</li>
        <li>What are you most pleased about in this project? Why?</li>
        <li>If given more time and resources, what would you develop further in this project?</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3>Submission</h3>
    <p>Depending on the platform you choose, your submission requirements will be different. If you use a platform that we worked with on a quick-make, you can follow those instructions for how to submit. Otherwise, you will need to look into this for your
        platform, drawing from your own knowledge of how things work in digital media. A few things to keep in mind:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You <strong>CANNOT</strong> submit links to Twine</li>
        <li>If you include images or other multimedia assets (including custom css) in a web-based project (a project with html, css, javascript) you will need to include a <strong>ZIPPED FILE DIRECTORY</strong> containing ALL of this content, nested correctly
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If all else fails, reach out to me and I will help you make sure you get everything submitted. But please keep in mind that the tightness of this deadline and my own grades' submission turn around means there is VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR ERROR!&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Your designer's statements should be submitted as PDFs (please, no word docs!)</strong></p>
    <p></p>
