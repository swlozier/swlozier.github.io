	<h3><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Digital Humanities Sequence Changes</strong></span></span></h3>

	<ul>
	<li style="margin: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: helvetica;">Replace&nbsp;<em>DCD 345: Knowledge Production and Digital Representation&nbsp;</em>with <em>DCD 300: Special Topics in Digital Studies</em></span></span></li>
	</ul>

	<p><span style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 14px;">These changes were approved by the English department in February 2023, and brought to academic affairs for inclusion in the 2023-2024 catalog in March 2023.</span></p>
