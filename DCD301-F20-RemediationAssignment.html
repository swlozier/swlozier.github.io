    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom: 0.5em; border-color: #AF4D98">About</h3>
    <p>For your final "big" project this semester, you will create your own adaptation/remediation of Frankenstein, following the adaptation and remediation discussions in class. You will primarily use using Inky -- the interactive text language developed
        by Inkle -- to explore the effects that interaction can have on adapting a narrative.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom: 0.5em; border-color: #F85E00">Task</h3>
    Select a passage, moment, chapter, or volume from Frankenstein that you would like to adapt in some way. Re-read it carefully, noting things like major themes present, settings, characters, and so on (this is a great place to refer back to your unit 1
    map). Re-work that moment to adapt it according to any of the lenses discussed in class:</div>
<div style="margin:2em">
    <ul>
        <li><b>plot adaptation</b>: what happens if the major events happen differently? What happens if you give more time or focus to minor events?</li>
        <li><b>cultural adaptation: </b>how does this moment or passage play out differently if set in or responsive to a different cultural moment than Mary Shelley's? How can you maintain some of the major themes or concerns, adapted for a different time?
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div style="margin:2em">Once you have determined the focus of your textual adaptation, you will write/create it using Inky, a mark-up program for creating choice-based narratives (similar to Twine, but with a different coding UI and output style).&nbsp;<br>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom: 0.5em; border-color: #086375">Requirements</h3>
    <p>While the length of your inspiration passage / moment can be anything at all, there are a few requirements for your own output.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You must include at least 15 moments of choice in the remediation (<i>20 if collab</i>.);</li>
        <li>You must include at least 3 points of custom CSS &amp; styling beyond Inky's default (<i>5 if collab.</i>)</li>
        <li>You must include at least 1 image (<i>3 if collab.)</i></li>
    </ul><i><b>Note</b>: In addition to the increased quantitative expectations for a collaboration, I will also be looking for a more complete and robust adaptation, in terms of how much of the story is there, how detailed the writing is, how critically and creatively you've approached your adaptation.&nbsp;<br>
    </i>
    <p></p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom: 0.5em; border-color: #AFFC41">Submission</h3>
    When you are finished writing your text in inky, you will <b>Export for the Web</b>. This will force-download a folder* (you should recognize it as a web page directory) with your game. You can then:</div>
<div style="margin:2em">
    <ul>
        <li>Zip / Compress the folder and upload it directly to Moodle</li>
        <li>Zip/Compress the folder and upload it to itch.io, then share the itch.io link in Moodle</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>*This folder is also where you will be able to find your .css file to customize your styling</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><span><span class="" style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);"><b>***Make sure you DO NOT move anything in the folder around, or leave anything out when you compress and submit to Moodle***</b></span></span>
    </p>
