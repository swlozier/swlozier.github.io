	<h1>About:</h1>
<p>On Monday and Wednesday 2/13 and 2/15, we will be conducting an in-class peer workshop on your storyboard and early copy drafting for your portfolios. </p>
<p></p>
<h1><span>Your Tasks:</span></h1>
<p><span>Collect &amp; Prepare your content:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Collect all of the DCD projects you want to include in your portfolio into a LOCAL folder on your computer. This should be the majority of what you've done in the program, especially in your upper level courses (300s and up) and/or subs;</li>
<li>Decide how you want to categorize these projects (eg: do you want them all to just be "projects"? Or do you want to sub-categorize them by topic, tool, collaboration, completion, etc.) Look back to some of the example portfolios for ways that you might think about categorizing, if you are unsure (note: we will workshop this too, so don't worry if you get it "wrong" the first time)</li>
<li>Write complete drafts of the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>Your bio</li>
<li>The contextualizing information about each project (the statement you use a to introduce the project, anything about the project you want a portfolio visitor to focus on, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span>Storyboard / Sketch your site design &amp; layout:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Sketch out (storyboard) how you want to organize your site: what will be on your landing page, what menu items you will have, etc. You want to keep this pretty flexible, since the design will depend on what platform you ultimately decide to build with, and what (if any) theme you use for that platform. <strong>Please actually sketch the design of your site -- you may use pencil &amp; paper or a digital program, but you should have multiple pages / drawings visually detailing how your site will be organized, how someone will move through the site, etc (think paper prototyping) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h1>Workshop:</h1>
<p>In class on Monday and Wednesday, we will conduct a peer workshop of these drafts and storyboards. Please come prepared to conduct this workshop, with this content ready to share. </p>
