<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>For your third major unit assignment, you will continue thinking through the people of social media, and the ways that people engage with, interact with, and work on these platforms.As we have discussed over the course of this unit, there is a wide range of ways that people work for and engage with these platforms, which includes content moderation to influencers.</p>
<p> font-size: 1rem;">As with the previous unit assignments, this is a research-driven practice but you will have a choice of topics to explore and engage with, sketched out below.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Topical Areas to Explore</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Content Moderation Policies and Practices:</strong> For this topic, you will explore and area that we opened the unit with, but have otherwise not spent much class time on: content moderation. On a platform of your choice, conduct a deep-dive research into their content moderation policy and practice -- what do their community guidelines say about their content moderation? What does their company culture say? What kinds of journalistic or academic reports can you find about their content moderation? What do users have to say about their content moderation? Are the policies applied equally across the platform? Do you agree with their content moderation policy and practice? Why/not?</p>
<p><strong>Comparative Study of Influencers:</strong>For this topic, you will continue exploring an area we've spent a lot of time on this unit: influencers. While this may begin with your work from the influencer show and tell exercise, you should expand that work so that this assignment will be a comparative analysis. There are two ways you can do your comparative analysis: for one, limit your research to one platform and compare three types of influencers on that platform (eg: a lifestyle influencer, a healthcare influencer, and food influencer), looking at the various ways the use the platform to exert their influence, the ways strategies may change depending on the sub-area, and looking to develop an informational essay about influencing practices on this platform. The second option is to look at one influencer and compare their practices across platforms, noting ways their instagram strategy is consistent with and different from their tiktok strategy (for instance). For this option, you will look to produce an informative report on one influencer's practices, offering this limited close evaluation and study as a lens through which to understand influencing more broadly.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Report of a Social Media subculture: </strong>This option invites you to explore an area we have not spent much class time on beyond readings: deep-diving and reporting on a subculture from social media, using the articles about food culture and urban / aesthetic culture post-Instagram as guides. For this topic, you will select a social media subculture of your choice -- GRWM, make-up tutorials, haul culture, books, gaming, food, art, etc -- and do a deep dive into this subculture as represented on a platform of your choice, then offer an analytical report on what this culture is, what its parameters and practices are, and how on- and offline cultures are influenced or responsive to it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once you have conducted your research, report your findings and insights, following either the critical or creative guidelines below. (Keep in mind, the creative platform for this unit is Instagram).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>CRITICAL APPROACH</h3>
<p>For the critical option, you will write a multimedia essay using the free, public "blogging" platform medium: <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">https://medium.com/</a></p>
You may need to make an account (though you should be able to do this for free), and once you are in their composing space, you will be able to incorporate multimedia elements from the web -- videos, images, links etc -- to support your essay. Please note that you are expected to incorporate multimedia as appropriate to your writing. You may consider using it for the following:</div>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<ul>
<li>Providing examples</li>
<li>Illustrating a point for greater analysis</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Word Count, Research &amp; Other Incidentals</h4>
<p>This is a critical, research-based multimedia essay, and while writing / researching to specs if not always a beneficial practice, I offer the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>you will need around 850-1000 words to effectively report on and evaluate your chosen platform;</li>
<li>you will need rich multimedia to support your findings (this will be part of your citationality);</li>
<li>you will need to create a bibliography if you consult outside sources (even things we read in class)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>SUBMISSION</h3>
<p>When you are finished with your essay:</p>
<ul>
<li>publish it;</li>
<li>share that link here as your submission</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is due SUNDAY 4/23 at 11:59 PM</strong></span></p>

<h2>Creative Option</h2>
<p>Per the syllabus, with each major assignment you have the option to do a more traditional critical written piece or a more creative multimedia piece, where you work in formats appropriate to the given unit's platform focus.</p>
<p>For this unit, our platform focus is Instagram so your creative option will be to use the Instagram platform, its affordances, and expectations as a creative outlet for your work. In other words, you will constrain your piece to what is expected, allowed, and appropriate for Instagram, while focusing on the same topical areas described above. This may take any of the following forms (though it is not limited to any of them):</p>
<ul>
<li>An Instagram Story, Reel, or Carousel that uses visual and textual communication practice to share your research findings around the topical area you choose above;Â </li>
<li>A series of instapoems, photographs, or other visual work that is inspired by and communicative of the research you've done above</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that these are just a few for how you might take the creative option with Instagram. I welcome discussion and brainstorming if you have other ideas but are not sure how to pursue them, or you want help is working with Instagram.</em></p>
<p><strong>Submissions will be dependent on what you decide to do, so please be in touch with me about how to submit, if you choose a creative option</strong></p>
<h3>Designer's Statement</h3>
<p>If you choose to do the creative option, you will also be responsible for submitting a written designer's statement, wherein you articulate and reflect on your creative process and goals.</p>
<p>Your designer's statements should be 500-750 words and address the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What were your goals for creatively using Instagram to communicate your research findings on the topical area of your choice?</li>
<li>How does your creative project use the affordances of Instagram to share your research findings?</li>
<li>Where did you struggle in this project? How did you overcome these struggles?</li>
<li>What are you most pleased about in this project? Why?</li>
<li>If given more time and resources, what would you develop further in this project?</li>
</ul>
