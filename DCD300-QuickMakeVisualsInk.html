    <h4>Quick Make: Visuals &amp; Ink</h4>
    <p><em>For this week's Quick Make, you will work with a tool called Inky -- a freely available platform for building hypertexts through mark-up practices (the primary platform behind Salt Immortal Sea) that outputs as HTML and CSS, making it an ideal platform for exploring both choice-based storytelling and visual content.</em></p>
    <p><em><br></em></p>
    <p></p><strong>PROMPT:&nbsp;</strong>Using the Inky environment and Ink language, create a short story that includes&nbsp;<strong>5 moments of choice</strong>&nbsp;for the reader to make. As well, create&nbsp;<strong>3 images</strong>&nbsp;using whatever
    tools you have available -- drawing and scanning; drawing on a tablet / digital environment; photographs; etc. -- that somehow fit within your story. Following the Inky Tutorials and Guides, incorporate these images into your short story in a way
    that is visually and narratively interesting.*&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin:2em">&nbsp; <strong>*Note: Inky runs on web-based output logic. So you are basically creating a web page and setting up a web page folder directory. Look back to DCD 102, Google, and other DCD web development classes for a refresher on how to do this</strong>.</div>
<div style="margin:2em">&nbsp;

    <p><span><em>During this (and every) Quick-make, I encourage you to also explore writerly storytelling techniques -- think about what stories might be interesting here or how the images can fit in a way that is compelling; consider following the theme of this week and creating a short adaptation of a story you already know (fairy tales work really well for this!).&nbsp;</em></span><em>As well, if you are familiar with Ink/Inky, I encourage you to try out a technique you have not used before -- Conditional content or custom CSS, for instance.</em></p>

    <p><span><span><strong>When you are done:</strong></span></span>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li><span><span><strong>Go to File &gt; Export for web.&nbsp;</strong>This will create a website directory folder with (among other things) a .css, .js, and .html folder. (Your images &amp; image folder will also need to be here in order for them to display in the Inky environment).</span></span>
        </li>
        <li><span><span><strong>ZIP / COMPRESS that ENTIRE FOLDER!&nbsp;</strong>Do not move anything or change anything. Just add your images, adjust your css (if you do any styling changes).&nbsp;</span></span>
        </li>
        <li><span><span><strong>Submit the ENTIRE COMPRESSED FOLDER To Moodle.</strong></span></span>
        </li>
