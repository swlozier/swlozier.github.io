    <h4><span>Quick Make: Readers as Writers</span></h4>
    <p><em>For this week's Quick Make, you will work with a tool called Twine -- a freely available platform for building hypertexts through a visual layout logic. It is very easy to get started, but contains LOTS of possibilities for more complex coding or programming or otherwise using the computational / digital space. (We will return to Twine for a few other Quick Makes this semester, because of this).</em></p>
    <p><strong>PROMPT:</strong><span>&nbsp;Using our primary source texts this week for topical inspiration, create a short story in Twine that features a situation where the reader must become a writer. Your story may be about any topic, but must contain the following:</span></p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>At least 5 passages in Twine</strong>, connected to one another (note: these do not necessarily have to be branching or multilinear passages, though they certainly can be).&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>At least 2 instances</strong><strong>&nbsp;where the reader WRITES</strong>&nbsp;part(s) of the narrative. Although choice-based and interactive narrative such as we've been reading this semester introduce the conceptual terrain of the
            reader-as-writer, for this quick make you should approach the reader-as-writer idea as literal. That is, there should be a text box (or something like it) where the reader can literally WRITE WORDS that will have some effect on the story (as
            in&nbsp;
            <em>First Draft of the Revolution</em>).&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>This will require more complex coding in Twine that most of you have likely explored. While you will need to figure out how to incorporate a writing feature into the short story you write, you can find the code and explanation
        in the Harlowe 3.2.2 manual (<em><span>HINT</span>:&nbsp;<a href="https://twine2.neocities.org/#macro_input-box" target="_blank">check out the input-box and force-input-box macros</a></em>).</p>
    <p></p>


    <p><span><em>During this (and every) Quick-make, I encourage you to also explore writerly storytelling techniques -- think about story instances where a reader might reasonably need to write something, for instance.&nbsp;</em></span><em>As well, if you are familiar with Twine (as I imagine most of you are), I encourage you to try out a technique you have not used before (beyond the requirements for this quick make).</em></p>
    <p><strong>SUBMISSION: </strong>Remember that if you are working with the online version of Twine, you <em><strong>CANNOT JUST SHARE THE LINK!</strong></em>&nbsp;When you are done, select <strong>PUBLISH TO FILE</strong> from the bottom left menu. This
        will create an <strong>HTML file</strong> and THAT is what you will submit here.</p>
