            <p><em>For
 this week's Quick Make, you will work with a tool called Twine -- a 
freely available platform for building hypertexts through a visual 
layout logic. It is very easy to get started, but contains LOTS of 
possibilities for more complex coding or programming or otherwise using 
the computational / digital space. (We will return to Twine for a few 
other Quick Makes this semester, because of this).</em></p>

            <p><strong>PROMPT:</strong> &nbsp;This week, your quick-make will explore additional complexity in Twine -- this time focusing on creating narrative effects through real-time limitations and constraints. This quick-make is inspired by Queers
                in Love at the End of the World, where we are forced to experience the game in 10 seconds of real time, a computational effect that prompts a frenzied, realist experience of an end of the world count-down</p>
            <p>For this quick-make, imagine a scenario that could appear in a narrative, but&nbsp; that can be (and in real life, would be), constrained by time, a build a short Twine text featuring this constraint. Your text can be about anything, but it
                must include the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>at least 3 passages <br></li>
                <li>at least 1 passage bound by time* where 1) the time constraint makes sense to the scenario; 2) the passage is designed such that the time constraint is felt by the reader/player</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em><strong>*You will need to use the Harlowe Guide and / or the WYSIWYG to find the code to do this</strong></em><br></p>
            <p></p>
            <p><em>During
 this (and every) Quick-make, I encourage you to also explore writerly 
storytelling techniques -- think about story instances where a reader 
might reasonably need to write something, for instance.&nbsp;</em><em>As
 well, if you are familiar with Twine (as I imagine most of you are), I 
encourage you to try out a technique you have not used before (beyond 
the requirements for this quick make).</em></p>
