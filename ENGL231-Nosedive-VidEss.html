<h1>Video Essay: Nosedive</h1>
<br>
<p>For this formal analysis video essay, you will focus on the ways this episode uses <b>Point of View shooting</b>. There are a number of examples of point of view throughout the episode -- some in the form of shot / reverse shot, some where we look literally
    through the eyes of the characters, as if we inhabit their bodies / minds.</p>
<p>Look for two examples of <b>point of view</b> in the episode (any two examples), and put together a 1-3 minute video essay in which you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify what point of view shooting is, using your chosen clips/stills to illustrate the technique<br></li>
    <li>Discuss the effects of POV on your chosen clips / stills within the context of the episode as a whole<br></li>
</ul>
<div>Remember that if you are having trouble getting clips because Netflix blocks content, you can take screen shots and put your video together using stills, or you can look for the content from other sources (YouTube, for instance) that has less sophisticated
    blocking practices.</div>
