<p>I decided to answer prompt 2 as I actually have some thoughts I want to share about it! I find the relationship in these types of storytelling interesting. The story often still has the information-exchange present in many types of storytelling, however now it is adding a new element to share with the reader; one that actively wants the reader to engage and create the story with them. It has the reader give input that the writer wants them to shape, such as locations, characters, feelings, etc. Even something as simply as having a way for the reader to put in a name helps them feel as though they are more apart of this story.
We also had to create something similar for this weeks Quick make, and one thing that I struggled with was grammar. It is hard to get the readers input to flow gracefully onto the pages; to have any option they put work completely fine. My best solution for this was to keep gender neutral wording whenever a person was discussed, and have as much simplistic grammar as possible when approaching an input phrase. Twine has been my favorite program to work in so far, and to me seems to be the best when it comes to creating stories with functions such as this!</p>
