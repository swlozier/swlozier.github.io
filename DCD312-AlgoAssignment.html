<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>For your second major unit assignment, you will continue thinking through the back-end, algorithmic and machinic processes that structure social media platforms, determining what content we see in those spaces. As we have discussed over the course of this unit, these processes are often presented as magical, even conspiratorial in the ways they seem to creepily "know" what we want. But in actuality, these processes are built on extreme data analysis at scale, and we are simply incredibly predictable people.</p>
<p>As with the first unit assignment, this is a research-driven practice, but that research process, sketched out below, will look a bit different than the research process you likely followed for the first major assignment.</p>
<h3>Research Process:</h3>
<p>At its core, your research will be conducted with the goal of tracking the kinds of content a given social media platform presents to you, looking for patterns in this content, considering how and why this content was offered to you, and analyzing your findings to suggest implications of insights into the algorithmic back-end that they offer. Below is a process I would recommend following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a social media platform that you use frequently (especially one with a robust feed); </li>
<li>Set a 3-5 day period where you will engage with this platform mindfully and purposefully, noting the kinds of content that it presents to you within a given time frame (1 hour or so); </li>
<li>When you come to the platform for the first time each day, notice what is presented to you to begin with -- are there any ads? Any trending topics? Any recommended pop ups or other things? If so, what's there? At this stage, simply note this</li>
<li>Begin engaging the feed, noting each item that appears and things like: who the item came from; why it was presented to you (if explicit, i.e. you follow the creator); if it is aligned with things you like or not;</li>
<li>For each item on the feed, keep a careful log of what shows up, looking for patterns;</li>
<li>As you log what shows up, think as well about why the algorithm matched the content to you -- are there demographic things you and the content or you and the creator have in common? Do you follow the creator or interact with the creator's other content? Do you interact with content that is topically related (consider very rudimentary relations too, like the same word, even if the context or spirit of the content is inconsistent)?</li>
<li>Remember to take screen shots and screen recordings in preparation for your essay</li>
</ul>
<p>Continue this process as long as you have set yourself and when you are done look for patterns that emerge. Do you see:</p>
<ul>
<li>topical patterns?</li>
<li>temporal patterns?</li>
<li>patterns that seem to speak to your own practices online?</li>
<li>patterns that may reveal how the algorithm understands you?</li>
<li>chaos? (itself a kind of pattern)</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind we are working at a relatively small scale so don't stress if the pattern percentages are very low (eg: 10% of the time, something happens -- this is still worth noting).</p>
<p>Once you have collected your data and identified some patterns, report your findings and insights that info, following either the critical or creative guidelines below. (Keep in mind, the creative platform for this unit is Twitter).</p>
<p></p>

<h3>CRITICAL APPROACH</h3>
<p>For the critical option, you will write a multimedia essay using the free, public "blogging" platform medium: <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">https://medium.com/</a></p>
You may need to make an account (though you should be able to do this for free), and once you are in their composing space, you will be able to incorporate multimedia elements from the web -- videos, images, links etc -- to support your essay. Please note that you are expected to incorporate multimedia as appropriate to your writing. You may consider using it for the following:</div>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<ul>
<li>Providing examples of what the feed provided you;</li>
<li>Providing examples of patterns;</li>
<li>Illustrating a point for greater analysis</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Word Count, Research &amp; Other Incidentals</h4>
<p>This is a critical, research-based multimedia essay, and while writing / researching to specs if not always a beneficial practice, I offer the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>you will need around 850-1000 words to effectively report on and evaluate your chosen platform;</li>
<li>you will need rich multimedia to support your findings (this will be part of your citationality);</li>
<li>you will need to create a bibliography if you consult outside sources (even things we read in class)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>SUBMISSION</h3>
<p>When you are finished with your essay:</p>
<ul>
<li>publish it;</li>
<li>share that link here as your submission</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is due SUNDAY, MARCH 26 at 11:59 PM</strong></span></p>

<h2>Creative Option</h2>
<p>Per the syllabus, with each major assignment you have the option to do a more traditional critical written piece or a more creative multimedia piece, where you work in formats appropriate to the given unit's platform focus.</p>
<p>For this unit, our platform focus is Twitter so your creative option will be to use the Twitter platform, its affordances, and expectations as a creative outlet for your work. In other words, you will constrain your piece to what is expected, allowed, and appropriate for Twitter, while focusing on the same topical area described above. This may take any of the following forms (though it is not limited to any of them):</p>
<ul>
<li>A Twitter Thread, following the model provided by Adore Me, that reports your findings and their implications with multimedia citationality and an engagement with the Twitter Thread as a rhetorical form;</li>
<li>An Interactive Twitter Adventure, where you use the interactions and choice-based models of a thread to guide your reader through an exploration of algorithmic logic (eg: use your own findings to guide a narrative);</li>
<li>A Twitter Bot that is purposefully and engagingly coded to reveal or otherwise shed light on your findings (note that you may need to sign up for Twitter Blue to access the API); </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that these are just a few for how you might take the creative option with Twitter. I welcome discussion and brainstorming if you have other ideas but are not sure how to pursue them, or you want help is working with Twitter.</em></p>
<p><strong>Submissions will be dependent on what you decide to do, so please be in touch with me about how to submit, if you choose a creative option</strong></p>
<h3>Designer's Statement</h3>
<p>If you choose to do the creative option, you will also be responsible for submitting a written designer's statement, wherein you articulate and reflect on your creative process and goals.</p>
<p>Your designer's statements should be 500-750 words and address the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What were your goals for creatively using Twitter to communicate your research findings about algorithmic back-ends and social media?</li>
<li>How does your creative project use the affordances of Twitter to share your research findings?</li>
<li>Where did you struggle in this project? How did you overcome these struggles?</li>
<li>What are you most pleased about in this project? Why?</li>
<li>If given more time and resources, what would you develop further in this project?</li>
</ul>
