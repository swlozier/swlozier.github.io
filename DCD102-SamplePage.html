    <p>This week, we will start working through some of our course content, getting started with thinking critically and creatively about web site design. We'll start with establishing an understanding of how the web actually works and how web sites are
        (basically) put together, and then we'll turn to analyzing existing web sites to start "reverse engineering" their design. You'll also have your first <b>MAJOR ASSIGNMENT</b> this week, the unit 1 <b>Web Site Close Reading</b>&nbsp;Assignment.</p>
    <p>All of your activities / tasks (listed below) should be completed by the end of the week: <b>SUNDAY, 1/31.</b></p>

        <p>Chapter one from our course textbook outlines the basic building blocks of the web, framing this in terms of print. If you have never really thought about print layout, it may be helpful to have a physical book near you (a textbook, encyclopedia,
            novel, or anything will work) to look at and think about in terms of design &amp; layout.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;As well, the chapter covers some basic features of HTML, CSS, and Javascript which we will be revisiting in Unit 2 (so do not freak out if you can't remember all of it! Just use this time to familiarize yourself with the ideas).</p>

    <h5 style="margin-bottom:1em"><b>Read "The Anatomy of a Web Site" Article&nbsp;</b></h5>
    <div style="margin-left:2em; border-left:double; border-color: rgba(194, 38, 197, 0.3); padding-left:1em">
        <p>This article provides a helpful overview and discussion of effective page layout, and ways to organize information in an online space. This will be useful as we move through this class. It will also be helpful to refer back to for your web page
            "close reading" assignment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><i><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;there are images included throughout the article that look a little like ads. These are example images that illustrate important design points, so take care when scrolling through.</i></p>

    <h5 style="margin-bottom:1em"><b>View / Respond to the Week Two VoiceThread</b></h5>
    <div style="margin-left:2em; border-left:double; border-color: rgba(194, 38, 197, 0.3); padding-left:1em">
        <p>Whenever I post something like a lecture this semester, I will do so as a Voicethread, rather than a video. I'll also work to keep these to 15-20 minutes each, though some may be a bit longer, depending on the content.&nbsp;This week, I'll use the Voicethread to provide you a methodological example of "close reading" a web site, so that you have a model to follow for your major assignment.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><i><b>Note</b>: The Voicethread is embedded below and you should be able to VIEW it there. If you would like to interact with it (leave a comment, question, etc.) you may need to go through the Class Voicethreads link on Moodle, so that all the permissions &amp; authentications are carried over.</i></p>

        <p>For this assignment, you will analyze 3 websites in terms of their design. Using the "Anatomy of a Web Site" article and the Voicethread example as your guides, you will take apart and examine the design elements of the sites, to ultimately offer
            an assessment of how well you think the site is designed, what is working and what isn't.</p>
        <p>For more, see the Close Reading Website Assignment (which is also where you will submit this work when you've completed it).</p>
