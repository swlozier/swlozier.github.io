<h2 style="border-bottom-style: solid; padding-bottom: .5em; border-color: GreenYellow;">Part 1<strong><br /></strong></h2>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>For the first part of your final project this semester, you will create a cross-platform suite of social media content  -- for 2 of the 4 platforms we've studied this semester -- based on a TikTok-related topic of your choice, <strong>or</strong> another social media topic that we covered in class and you'd like to explore more fully.</p>
<p><strong>What is a cross-platform suite of content?</strong></p>
<p>A cross-platform suite means that you will create content specific to two of the four platforms we've studied this semester -- Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok -- that should be consistent with the constraints, cultures, and expectations of those platforms. The primary content should be the same, but the form will change based on the platform -- how your represent and communicate your information via Twitter will differ from how you do this for Instagram (for instance).</p>
<h3>TikTok Topics</h3>
<p>Since we did not get to study TikTok in as much depth as the other platforms this semester, you have the option to focus on something from this platform. Some ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>an explanation of practices, cultures, major players, histories, etc of a "side" of tiktok (booktok, Miami Boys Choir Tok, weddingtok, traveltok, Drake Passage Tok)</li>
<li>an explanation of a trend or meme that has come and gone from the platform (Berries and Cream remixes, Sea Shantys, GentleMinions, The Ratatoozical etc) that addresses things like where the trend started, how it works, who participated, what the rules are, and so on</li>
<li>"follow a sound" -- take a popular sound, find its source, and share its history, practices, the types of videos its tied to, etc</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Topics</h3>
<p>Look back through this semester's topics -- the weekly schedules on Moodle, the syllabus, your notes -- and choose a topics you'd like to examine further that we didn't get enough time in class. Research that topics or phenomenon and create your suite of content sharing more information about this area. Some ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>influencers or other subcultures of Instagram</li>
<li>Instapoetry</li>
<li>Social Media Activism</li>
<li>Histories of social media platforms (not the one you did for unit 1)</li>
<li>Elon Musk's Twitter</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Regardless of the topic you choose, your content should aim to educate -- likely through a lens of critical explanation -- on the topic you've chosen, and you should do this using whatever method of "receipts" and citationality is appropriate to the platform you've created for (clips, screenshots, links, etc).<br /><br /></p>
<h3 style="border-bottom-style: solid; padding-bottom: .5em; border-color: CornflowerBlue;">Part 2</h3>
<p>In addition to your content creation, you will be responsible for a 750-1000 word reflective essay that looks back over the semester. Your essay may be casual and should be personal, and should reflect back on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the primary things you learned in each unit? Do these things change how you approach social media in your own life? Why/not?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What was the most surprising thing you learned this semester? The most interesting? </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What was the most challenging thing you learned or did this semester?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What as your most favorite project / unit / topic this semester? Why?</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Keep in mind this should not be a Q&amp;A list in response to these questions, but that these questions are here to prompt your reflective writing. This should be an essay (with paragraphs), and should adhere to expectations and standards of idiom and mechanics appropriate to college-level writing in English.</p>

<h2>ASSESSMENT</h2>
<p>Unlike some of the other assignments you've done for this class, this assignment does not have a strict quantitative amount of what you should create. In other words, there is no minimum number of videos or images, or length of time you should be recording, or other metric. That is because it will vary depending on platform and topic. The successful approach to this project is then following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantify how much to make based on <strong>what is appropriate to the platform</strong> -- how many TikToks makes sense for a playlist? How many are necessary for the topic? Just because you CAN make 1 10-minute video, should you? Will anyone watch it? Is that appropriate to the platform? etc.</li>
<li><strong>Describe and Explain your topic sufficiently</strong> -- have you provided a sufficient explanation to understand the topic you're describing? Have you given a history? Have you described rules / guidelines / context or other incidentals sufficiently? Are there enough examples? Are they diverse? </li>
<li><strong>Design your content</strong> so that it is appropriate to the platform -- Instagram Squares vs. portrait orientation stories; Tweets vs. Captions; In-app on-screen text for TikTok videos.</li>
</ul>

<h3>SUBMISSION</h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This is due FRIDAY 5/5 at 11:59 PM</strong></span></p>
<p>Please submit your reflection as a PDF.</p>
<p>The social media content will be shared as appropriate to the platform you are using, but you may submit either as existing content that you create on your own accounts, or as exported content to be shared elsewhere (eg: using Canva, Capcut, or other tools)</p>
<p><em><strong>If you would like me to consider featuring your content on any of our DCD socials, please note that in your submission, and include any additional information necessary to sharing the content in-app (eg: if you use a particular TikTok sound, please link it or name it so I can find it)</strong></em></p>
