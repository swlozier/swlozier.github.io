<h1>Reflection: <em>Digital: A Love Story</em> and <em>The First Draft of the Revolution</em></h1>
<br>
    <div><p>This week, our focus has been on two texts that use the affordances of digital technology to tell stories that re-visit and offer alternatives to historical moments: the advent of the popular internet in 1988 in <em>Digital: A Love Story</em>, and the French Revolution in <em>First Draft of the Revolution</em>. At the same time, these texts imagine and enact a new role for the reader, inviting the reader to take on, in various capacities and procedures, the role of writing. In Digital: A Love Story, we see this in the replies and messages that the reader/player must sent to progress the story along, and in First Draft of the Revolution, we see this in the epistolary structure of the story, where the reader/writer moves the text along by choosing different ways to respond to the letters she receives.</p></div>

                <p dir="ltr">Please respond to one of the prompts below for this week's reflective post:</p>
            <p dir="ltr"></p>
            <ol>
                <li>One of the most common forms of storytelling in multimedia formats is to revisit a moment in history (or historical figure) and tell a narrativized, in some cases fictionalized, version of that history or figure. This happens throughout
                    media forms -- books, television shows, movies, games, digital novels, etc. -- and we see it in both our primary texts for this week. What are some of the ways that <em>Digital: A Love Story</em> and <em>First Draft of the Revolution</em> maintain consistency
                    between their narratives and the historical record of these moments? What are some ways they change things about this historical moment? What is the effect of these changes? How do these changes resonate with the current moment in
                    which you are reading / playing the texts? What do you think it is about these historical moments makes them fruitful for revisiting in this way?&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Traditionally, the reader and the writer form an information-exchange relationship that is separate, if symbiotic: the writer prepares some kind of information to share with the reader, who through the act of reading, consumes that information.
                    In these texts, however, this relationship is disrupted as the reader is invited into a writerly position that, as we see to varying degrees, has a meaningful effect on the course of the narrative. As well, in your quick-make you explored
                    ways to create a reader-as-writer role through a short Twine narrative. What are some challenges that come with introducing this kind of information-transfer or relationship disruption? What does the writer need to be careful of when
                    inviting a reader to become a writer in their text? What are some benefits of this kind of storytelling? What challenges did you run into when conceptualizing and building this kind of opportunity in your quick-make? How did you overcome
                    these challenges, and how does this affect your narrative or storytelling practices?</li>
            </ol>
