    <p>This is your fifth, and final major assignment in this class, before the final reflection. You have a number of choices for approaching this work, as noted below. As well, you have the week of 4/26 - 5/2 to work on this.</p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid; border-color:#8883B2; padding-bottom:0.5em">Task</h3>
    <p>To close our our electronic literature unit, you will each create a work of electronic literature. The type of work is entirely up to you, but you are constrained to one of the four types that we looked at in detail last week:</p>
    <p><b>AUGMENTED REALITY NARRATIVE</b></p>
    <p>Following the model of <i>Between Page and Screen, </i>create a short narrative that uses Augmented Reality to play with text and image. The text must have at least 5 triggers, and you may do a paper prototype (following the example of last unit's
        assignment) if the technology is not working.</p>
    <p><b>HYPERTEXT NARRATIVE</b></p>
    <p>Following the model of <i>Hunt for the Gay Planet, </i>use Twine to write and design a choice-based narrative. The narrative must have at least 10 moments of choice, and include some advanced programming per the tutorial and in-class Twine work ("if"
        statements, text styling, etc.).</p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 0.9375rem; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;;">Following <i>The Dreamlife of Letters, </i>design and stage a piece of kinetic poetry using Stepworks. You have many options for how to approach this. If you are poetically-inclined, you may write an original piece; you can create a "lyric video" similar to what we did in class to Lubalin's song; you can modify an existing poem to make it kinetic. The piece must be a complete poem, with attention to rhythm and one-click interactions of Stepworks.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 0.9375rem;">&nbsp;Following the numerous twitterbot examples, use Tracery and Cheapbotsdonequick (CBDQ) to create a text generator. You could keep this VERY literary by creating a generator that writes poetry or tells short stories, or you can go more non-traditional and play with emojis, memes, familiar sayings, existing text, or something else. The twitterbot must be presented as part of a fully realized twitter profile (cover / profile images, bio explaining that it is a bot, a good name, etc.) and have at least 5 rules beyond the origin, and ~20 alternatives per rule (to the extent that this makes sense).&nbsp;</span></p>

    <h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid; border-color:#8883B2; padding-bottom:0.5em">Designer's Statement</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>In addition to your work of e-lit, you will be responsible for writing a short designer's statement in which you reflect on your designs and discuss them in terms of the following:</p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>What were your narrative and design goals for this project?</li>
        <li>How well do you think you achieved each of these goals?</li>
        <li>Did you use any of the example texts as inspiration for your work? If so, which ones? If not, where did you draw inspiration for this work?</li>
        <li>What was the most challenging part of this project?</li>
        <li>If given more time / resources, what would you improve on this mini-project?</li>
    </ol><br>
    <p></p>

    <h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid; border-color:#8883B2; padding-bottom:0.5em">Submission</h3>
    <p>Submit your work here, by May 2 11:59 PM according to the following:</p>
    <p><b>AR: </b>you will need to output to share depending on the program you use. If you can't figure it out, email me.</p>
    <p><b>Hypertext: </b>When you are finished, select "Publish to File" from the menu. Submit that .html file here.</p>
    <p><b>Kinetic Poetry: </b>Submit a LINK to your poem here, AND a link to the google doc you worked from</p>
    <p><b>Twitter bot: </b>Submit a LINK to your bot here, AND a link to the CBDQ source code (make sure you set the source code to "view" in the dropdown).</p>
    <p><b>All designer statements should be submitted as PDFs</b></p>
    <p><b><br></b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>

    <h3 style="border-bottom-style:solid; border-color:#8883B2; padding-bottom:0.5em">Assessment</h3>
    <p>You will be assessed according to the following:</p>
    <p><b>E-Lit Prototype (70%): </b>Your e-lit prototype tells a complete story or poem, according to the type parameters set above. You've clearly and creatively engaged with the capabilities of the platform you are using.</p>
    <p><b>Designer's Statement (30%): </b>Your designer's statement responds thoroughly and thoughtfully to the prompt questions, and does so with attention to standards and expectations of written English (spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc.).</p>
