        <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; border-color: #a0f2b4; padding-botto: 1em">Task</h3>
        <p>Choose a meaty passage from Frankenstein (~500-1000 words) that is rich in character and setting. Following rules and practices of TEI, mark-up this passage so that it may be machine-readable, as if you were preparing a rich digital edition. Read
            this passage closely and mark-up the following things:</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>characters (including pronouns);</li>
            <li>settings (including pronouns or other unnamed references);</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because you will be working closely with people and places in the text, you should also plan to create and include a &lt;TEIHeader&gt; with appropriate metadata for all Headers, and additionally a:</p>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personography (for hosting more detailed information about your characters)</li>
            <li>Placeography (for hosting more detailed information about your places)</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>Since you will be working with a relatively small amount of text, you should plan to create a rich marked-up file.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b><span class="" style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);">Remember that you will need to work in a plain text editor (<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">like Sublime</a>), set to XML.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

    </div>

    <div>Your grade for this part of the digital edition assignment will be calculated according to the following:</div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div><b>CONTENT ACCURACY (30%)</b>: Is your mark-up accurate according to Frankenstein? (i.e. is you tag "she" as "Elizabeth," is right?")</div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div><b>SYNTAX ACCURACY (40%)</b>: Does your mark-up follow the rules of XML syntax and TEI guidelines? Have you nested your tags correctly? Have you used attributes correctly? Do your elements and attributes actually exist in TEI?&nbsp;</div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div><b>RICHNESS / ROBUSTNESS (30%): </b>Have you followed the guides above and 1) chosen a rich passage and 2) marked it up in a way that is sufficiently robust?</div>

    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom: 0.5em; border-color: #AF4D98">About</h3>
    <p>This is the second part of the two-part major assignment for this unit, which connects your back-end passage mark-up, with a front-end user interface where you imagine a digital edition that makes use of the machine readability of your passage.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom: 0.5em; border-color: #F85E00">Task</h3>
    <p>When you have completed your passage mark-up, you will create a paper prototype of a digital edition / user interface design that takes creative advantage of things your mark-up has enabled, by making the text machine readable. In other words, now
        you get to imagine things that you COULD do as a fully rendered digital edition, because the computer understands your text as more than just strings of characters. We've discussed many ideas in class, but to get your creativity going think about:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>now that the computer can understand character names as characters, how could you use this to multimedia or analytical advantage?&nbsp;</li>
        <li>now that the computer can understand settings and places in meaningful, potentially "real-world" ways, what could you do with your digital edition?</li>
        <li>what kinds of searching could you enable?</li>
        <li>what kinds of visualizations?&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have decided the kinds of things you want to enable, you have the second task of sketching a user interface design -- on hardware of your choice -- that shows what the user would do to effect these things. To take some examples from class:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>if you were going to create a visualization tool to show how often certain characters speak, then what kinds of buttons, text, and outputs would you put on your digital to lead your human user to this practice?&nbsp;</li>
        <li>if you were going to trigger audio readings that matched voices with different characters, what buttons, icons, texts or other things would you include on the UI that would communicate to human users how to start the audio reading?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Again -- these are just a couple of ideas to get you started.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom: 0.5em; border-color: #086375">Requirements</h3>
    <p>You have a lot of creative freedom for this paper prototype, but you must adhere to the following:</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>What you imagine at the front-end must be conceptually possible based on your mark-up at the back-end (so, for instance, if you have not marked up characters according to gender in your personography, then you cannot do a gender-breakdown visualization)
        </li>
        <li>there must be AT LEAST one specific and precise point of connection that deals with characters (and personography) and one that deals with settings (placeography). Again, what this looks like is up to you, and there may be more; this is just a
            minimum requirement.
        </li>
        <li>You must work with paper, and create a new screen and sketch that represents each time the screen would change in the "real" version.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br></p>
    <h3 style="border-bottom:solid; padding-bottom: 0.5em; border-color: #AFFC41">Submission</h3>
    <p>When you have completed your prototype, create a user-flow video, where you film the screens in order, showing how each interaction would following from the next (use the video examples from <a href="https://moodle.coastal.edu/mod/page/view.php?id=624570"
            data-title="Week 10: Oct 25-31" data-action="launch-tiles-standard">&nbsp;Week 10: Oct 25-31</a> as guides). You have the option to include commentary via on-screen text or audio if you want -- you may find this helpful to explain your vision
        -- but this is not required.</p>
    <p><b><span class="" style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);">Your video is due, submitted via Moodle, by 11:59 pm, SUNDAY Nov 8</span></b><span class="" style="color: rgb(192, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p>
